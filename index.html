            <h2> Once upon a time...</h2>
                <p> Walt Disney moved to California in 1923 with hopes of expanding his cartoon work. He had created Alice's Wonderland, which led to a contract for the Alice Comedies, marking the start of his company. Initially named Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, the company soon became known as Walt Disney Studio.

                    After losing rights to his character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in 1927, Walt created Mickey Mouse, which debuted in Steamboat Willie (1928). Mickey became an instant sensation, leading to further cartoons and the successful Silly Symphonies series. The studio expanded into merchandising, starting with Mickey-themed products.
                    
                    In 1934, Walt decided to create an animated feature, which led to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), a major hit. Despite WWII-related struggles, Disney persevered with films like Pinocchio and Fantasia, though the financial strain was significant. Post-war, Disney adapted, producing live-action films and documentary-style nature films, including the True-Life Adventure series.</p> <a href="https://d23.com/app/uploads/2022/07/WDAPL_AnimatedFeatures_00300_am_R.jpg " >
